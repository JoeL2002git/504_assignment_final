# Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a compact healthcare cloud solution that integrates multiple platforms, including Azure and Google Cloud (GCP). The implemented design focuses on automated claims processing and an analytics dashboard. The solution enables healthcare billers to upload claim files, process them automatically, and generate reports and visualizations from the resulting data.

## Project Use Case
1. Define the target problem and the intended users of the solution.  
   - Write a clear problem statement.  
   - Describe the proposed solution.  
   - Identify and describe the target users who will benefit from the solution.  

2. Describe the data used in the solution.  
   - Explain the types of data utilized in the system.  
   - Identify the data sources and how the data is obtained.  

3. Outline the basic workflow of the solution.  
   - Provide a sequential list detailing how the application functions.  
   - Begin with the user’s interaction with the system and end with how the solution addresses the problem or produces a result for the user.  

## Architecture Diagram
Create a diagram for all the components of the solution and the data flow.
- Show the different layes of the architecture.
- Show all the cloud based services implemented.

## Architecture & Implementation Plan  
1. Develop a service map.  
   - Identify the layers in which each cloud service operates.  
   - Describe the function of each cloud service within the overall solution.  
   - Indicate the assignment or module where each cloud service was discussed.  

2. Create a data flow narrative.  
   - Provide a detailed walkthrough of how data moves through the system from input to output.  

3. Security, identity, and governance.  
   - Explain the security measures implemented to protect data and ensure compliance.  

4. Cost and operational management.  
   - Describe the strategies used to minimize application costs and optimize resource utilization. 

## Reflection  
Write a reflective summary of the design process.  
- Discuss the creator’s level of confidence in various aspects of the design.  
- Describe any alternative architectures that were considered during development.  
- Explain potential future improvements or implementations that could be made with additional time and resources.
