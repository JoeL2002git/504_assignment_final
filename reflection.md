## Reflection

The core data flow and service mapping form the strongest foundation of this RPM hypertension pipeline design. Confidence is highest in the serverless Azure Functions + Blob Storage ingestion layer, which directly applies Module 5 compute patterns for event-driven ETL on small-scale healthcare data. The Azure SQL Serverless database schema for patient_daily_metrics and rpm_alerts tables leverages Module 7 relational design principles, ensuring efficient dashboard queries for nurse worklists. Streamlit dashboards via Container Apps (Module 10 Docker) provide a practical clinician interface that balances simplicity with interactivity, staying true to the mini-pipeline scope.

Least confidence exists in the AI/ML layer (Module 9). While Azure ML notebooks could score hypertension risk from BP trends, the simplistic rule-based alerting in the baseline design avoids model complexity suitable for a semester project. Scaling patient matching across EHR exports and RPM vendor IDs during nightly syncs presents integration risks if vendor JSON schemas change unexpectedly. Cost projections (~$20-40/month) assume student-tier optimization but could spike with unexpected Data Factory pipeline runs or SQL query volume from multiple dashboard users.

### Alternative Architecture Considered
A fully managed Azure Synapse Analytics + Power BI Premium stack was evaluated as an enterprise alternative, consolidating ETL, SQL warehousing, and embedded analytics into one service (similar to Module 8 databases). This would simplify ops through native FHIR connectors for EHR data and serverless Spark pools for vitals aggregation. However, Synapse's $100+/month minimum for dedicated pools exceeds student budgets, lacks granular serverless scaling for sporadic RPM data volumes (10-100 patients), and over-engineers a teaching pipeline needing modular service exposure from HHA-504 modules. The chosen Functions + SQL + Power BI Embedded hybrid better demonstrates cross-module integration while staying under $50/month.

### Next Steps with Extended Timeline & Budget
With 4-8 additional weeks and production credits, first priority would integrate Azure Health Data Services (FHIR server) for true EHR connectivity, mapping RPM vitals to Observation resources with SMART-on-FHIR auth for clinician single sign-on. Week 3-4: deploy Azure ML risk models trained on synthetic BP datasets, predicting 30-day stroke risk and auto-escalating critical alerts via Logic Apps to physician pagers. Weeks 5-6: add patient-facing Azure Static Web App with real-time BP trend charts and medication adherence nudges via Twilio SMS, A/B testing engagement protocols.

Final month focuses production hardening: Azure Defender for SQL PHI detection, VNet peering for private endpoints (Module 4 networking), and Terraform IaC (Module 2 cost management) with GitHub Actions CI/CD. Benchmark against CMS RPM billing metrics (16+ days/month readings), targeting 80% patient control rates in simulated cohorts. This evolves the mini-pipeline into a deployable health system asset ready for Stony Brook University Hospital capstone demo.
